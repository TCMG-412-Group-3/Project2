Thierry's comment: The Last of Us is such a goated show! Pedro Pascal is a great actor!

##### Gaby would recommend the movie Puss in Boots: The Last Wish the most as it appeals to the widest range of audience members. The lighthearted, animated film takes you on a colorful adventure with one of the most popular Shrek characters, Puss in Boots.
